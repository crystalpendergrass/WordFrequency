Assignment #3 for CPSC2108 [Data Structures]

This assignment was to help familiarize us with using linked lists as a data structure.  I chose to use the existing LinkedList class shown in Java's API.  

To test this assignment, I used random text from Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java by Koffman and Wolfgang (the textbook assigned for this course), Dr. Seuss's Oh The Place You Will Go, and the traditional lorem ipsum (www.lipsum.com).
